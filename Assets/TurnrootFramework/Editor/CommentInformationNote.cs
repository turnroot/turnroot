* Overall, this script allows you to add notes
* or comments to GameObjects in the Unity Editor,
* making it easier to communicate essential information
* about GameObjects or their components to other developers
*
*           WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY
*           you will lose all data
*
* By wrapping the script inside the #if UNITY_EDITOR directive,
* it will only be compiled and executed in the Unity Editor.
* When you build your project, the script will be excluded from the build,
* and it won't impact the final game. It may need to add using UnityEditor;
* at the beginning of the script if you encounter any issues with the
* #if UNITY_EDITOR directive.
